# BATBASH

Aggressively throttle background tabs to squeeze every last drop of battery life while keeping the websites intact when you return.

## What it does

- Puts **any** background tab into a deep-sleep state after a few seconds
- Pauses timers, animations, media, workers, canvas, and observers
- Whitelist your favorite sites (YouTube, Spotify, etc.) with two clicks
- Restores the page **instantly** when you switch back—scroll position intact

## Whitelist manager

1. Click the BATBASH toolbar icon → “Whitelisted Sites”
2. Type domain (e.g. `youtube.com`) → Enter
3. All sub-domains (`music.youtube.com`, `www.youtube.com`) stay awake automatically
